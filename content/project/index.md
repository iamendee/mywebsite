Bayesian information criteria are computed on conditional or marginal likelihoods. This study uses simulation technique to assess relative model-fit of three dichotomous (1PLM, 2PLM, and 3PLM) and three polytomous (GRM, PCM, and GPCM) item response theory models based on conditional and marginal likelihoods of three information criteria.
