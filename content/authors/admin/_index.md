I am a Research Scientist at Human Resources Research Organization (HumRRO) in Alexandria, VA. I provide psychometric support for different HumRRO projects. My tasks include psychometric analyses, item parameter calibrations, and test scaling and equating. I also support testing efforts, including assembling test forms and maintaining longitudinal item banks.
